# EPR2021
The full, integrated code for EPR2021

Essentially this is a project with a Qt GUI that controls a motor with PID, takes a photo every time the motor completes one rotation and can apply some 
image processing to those photos. Pretty much all done with C++, made for Jetson Nano 2GB using an IMX219 camera sensor.
